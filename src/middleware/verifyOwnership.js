/**
 * verifyOwnership
 *
 * Ensures that the authenticated user is only allowed to access
 * or modify their own resources. This protects routes such as:
 *   GET /users/:id
 *   DELETE /users/:id
 *
 * The middleware compares:
 *   - req.user.user_id        → extracted from the JWT
 *   - req.params.id           → the user ID in the request URL
 *
 * If the IDs do not match, the user is blocked with a 403 error.
